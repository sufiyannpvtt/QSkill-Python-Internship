# Final Insights – Student Performance Analysis

This section summarizes the key findings derived after data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis, and performance segmentation.

---

## 1. Attendance Impact
Students with attendance greater than 75% consistently achieved higher final marks.
Low attendance (below 60%) is strongly associated with poor academic performance.

---

## 2. Study Hours vs Performance
Study hours have a positive impact on academic performance up to approximately
6–7 hours per day. Beyond this threshold, improvement in marks slows down,
indicating diminishing returns.

---

## 3. Gender-based Trends
Female students show a slightly higher median performance compared to male students,
although the overall performance distribution remains similar across genders.

---

## 4. Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis of numerical features reveals:
- Strong positive correlation between attendance and final marks
- Moderate correlation between study hours and final marks
- Internal marks act as a strong predictor of final results

---

## 5. Performance Segmentation
Students were classified into four performance categories:
- Excellent
- Good
- Average
- Poor

The majority of students fall under the Average and Good categories, while
Poor-performing students typically show low attendance and fewer study hours.

## Conclusion
Attendance consistency and effective study habits are the most influential factors
affecting student performance. Early identification of at-risk students can help
improve academic outcomes.
