# Model Working Explanation

The model uses Linear Regression to estimate house prices.

## Working

- Input features are multiplied by learned coefficients.
- A bias term is added to compute the final price.
- Regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) are used to control overfitting.

## Why Linear Regression?

- Easy to interpret
- Strong baseline for regression problems
- Works well with small to medium datasets

## Evaluation

- MAE and RMSE measure prediction error
- R² measures how well the model explains variance
